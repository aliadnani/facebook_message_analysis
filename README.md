## Key Statistics

### Using GROUPBY & COUNT functions

| Metric                                  | Value       |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
| Total Number of Messages Sent           | 145406      |
| Number of Photos Sent                   | 3179        |
| Number of Videos Sent                   | 141         |
| Total Number of Words Sent              | 2579381     |
| Total Number of Characters Sent         | 545485      |

| Average Character Count per Message     | 18.20966615 |

**Key Takeaways:**

- I text considerably more than the average person in my demographic (Every day people, aged 18â€“24, send **and receive** about 128 texts -> 64 sent per day); I am on 98.6
- **However,** my texting style is inconcise (Average Word Count per Message: 18.209),as often breaking up longer texts into shorter messages; eg (Hi! <send>, are you hungry? <send>, I'm going to cook <send>)
- Average of 1 photo sent per 50 text messages
	


### Messages Sent Over Time (Binned by day)
### From Mar 3, 2013 - Mar 19, 2020
  
I didn't have too many texting friends until high school where I began texting alot more.

This data may not be 100% representative as I occasionally also used WhatsApp to communicate throughout the years.

## Most Common Words
My day-to-day vocabulary is generally kept simple and casual.
(note: punctuation & capitals have been removed, there is an error in 'its' because it's and its counts have been summed together because of thi tokenization))

## Markov Chain Text Generator

Initially Markov chain using this implementiation:

		from collections import defaultdict, Counter
		import random
		import sys

		STATE_LEN = 4

		data = sys.stdin.read()
		model = defaultdict(Counter)

		for i in range(len(data) - STATE_LEN):
				state = data[i:i + STATE_LEN]
				next = data[i + STATE_LEN]
				model[state][next] += 1

		state = random.choice(list(model))
		out = list(state)
		for i in range(400):
				out.extend(random.choices(list(model[state]), model[state].values()))
				state = state[1:] + out[-1]
		print(''.join(out))
    
But later switched to Markovify python library.
