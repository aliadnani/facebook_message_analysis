# Facebook Message Analysis

Analysis done on my downloaded Facebook Messenger data



## Key Statistics

### Using GROUPBY & COUNT functions

| Metric                                  | Value       |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
| Total Number of Messages Sent           | 145406      |
| Number of Photos Sent                   | 3179        |
| Number of Videos Sent                   | 141         |
| Total Number of Words Sent              | 2579381     |
| Total Number of Characters Sent         | 545485      |
| Average Number of Messages Sent per Day | 98.64721845 |
| Average Word Count per Message          | 3.751461425 |
| Average Character Count per Message     | 18.20966615 |

**Key Takeaways:**

- I text considerably more than the average person in my demographic (Every day people, aged 18â€“24, send **and receive** about 128 texts -> 64 sent per day); I am on 98.6.
- **However,** my texting style is inconcise (Average Word Count per Message: 3.7), as I am often breaking up longer texts into shorter messages; eg (Hi! (send), are you hungry? (send), I'm going to cook (send))
- Average of 1 photo sent per 50 text messages (interesting find: I thought this would be more).
	


### Messages Sent Over Time (Binned by day)
### From Mar 3, 2013 - Mar 19, 2020
  
I didn't have too many texting friends until high school where I began texting alot more; but texting in high school was mainly done over WhatsApp. I started using Messenger after starting university (Sept. 2017).

**Interesting Observation:** That sudden decrease in between 2018 and 2019 is during the months of June - August where I had a summer job and had probably less time to text. Summer vacation could also mean I would see my friends more in person and would less likely text. I can't be exactly sure.
  
I also went on vacation to Indonesia in August where the connectivity was low which could also be a factor in the decrease in messages sent too.

## Most Common Words
My day-to-day vocabulary is generally kept simple and casual.

| i    | 17451 | a   | 7888 | yeah | 4497 |

### Extras: Longest Words & Longest Message
The longest string I have sent is 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...' with a length of 1512 'a's to annoy my friend :) . Another notable mention is 'hahahahahahahaha...' with a length of 312. Some Website links I have sent have also ended being long as well (+50 chars).

The longest valid word I have sent in which the word is a member of (https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) is a tie between 4 words that have 16 chars: 'entrepreneurship', 'responsibilities', 'semiprofessional', and 'electromagnetism'. It turns out, I seldom use big words in day to day texting. (Fun fact: 1.708% of the words in the ^^english words list have a length greater than 16)

The longest message I have sent turned out to be an English essay assignment I sent over to a friend for their review as plain text, the length was ~8000 characters/1500 Words.

## Messages Sent by Hour

I text alot throughout the day with peak texting hours at 6-10pm and off-hours at 3-5am where I'm most days I am asleep.

I originaly wanted to take into account the timezone of the place I was texting from, but this is not possible as location_message_was_sent_from is not an attribute of the downloaded data. Howeve, I think this data is more or less representative as I have mainly been staying in one timezone (Hong Kong) and have only been out of the country for at most 3 weeks in a year at Indonesia where the timezone offset is only 1 hour. 

| hour_of_day | count | hour_of_day | count | hour_of_day | count | hour_of_day | count |

## Extras: Message Conciseness

Reflecting on how i only text 3.7 words per message, I originally suspected that as time continued, my conciseness went down, as I vaguely remembering typing out full sentences as much as possible when starting to text. However, a graph shows this is not the case and that my message conciseness fluctuates quite a bit from 2013-2017 when I texted less on FB Messenger but stabilizes after Sept. 2017 where I begin to text alot on FB Messenger.

Maybe I would get a better result if I can also integrate my WhatsApp data from 2013-2017 when I first started getting into texting, however I am upset that I have lost this data when moving phones a while ago.

## Markov Chain Text Generator

The original scope of this project was to generate a predictive model from my language style and how I text for generating text; similar to the word prediction on your phone keyboard.

This implementation of a simple predictive model uses markov chains.

Some good resources:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain
https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/making-a-text-generator-using-markov-chains-e17a67225d10

Initially implemented Markov chains using this code:

		from collections import defaultdict, Counter
		import random
		import sys

		STATE_LEN = 2

		data = sys.stdin.read()
		model = defaultdict(Counter)

		for i in range(len(data) - STATE_LEN):
				state = data[i:i + STATE_LEN]
				next = data[i + STATE_LEN]
				model[state][next] += 1

		state = random.choice(list(model))
		out = list(state)
		for i in range(400):
				out.extend(random.choices(list(model[state]), model[state].values()))
				state = state[1:] + out[-1]
		print(''.join(out))
    
But later switched to Markovify python library (https://github.com/jsvine/markovify).

| 9 | fillet is the universe disappear what would she take him back |

## LSTM Text Generation

There is also code in this project to train a LSTM model to generate text. Its mainly untested as I haven't gotten around to training a model to a high number of epochs.

The weights model that is supplied is trained for 1 epoch and is generally low quality usually generating strings like: 'ssddd sddff'

I intend to train this model further when I get tensorflow set up on my graphics-card-equipped desktop PC.
